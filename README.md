# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📝 Project Overview

This project presents a dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to help hospital administrators and emergency staff monitor and improve performance in a busy Emergency Room (ER). The dashboard tracks real-time metrics such as patient volume, triage categories, wait times, and discharge trends — making it easier to allocate resources and enhance patient care.

## 📈 Key Insights

- 🚨 High patient load is consistently observed between 6–9 PM  
- ⏱ Patients in **Triage Category 1 (critical)** wait the longest before seeing a doctor  
- 📉 Discharge-to-admission ratios show inefficiencies in department handoffs  
- 📍 Departments like **General Medicine** and **Pediatrics** see the most re-visits  
- 📊 Dashboards allow real-time drill-through filtering by category, time, and department
